# Some projects that I am proud of and can share publicly.

### The projects fall into four categories.
#### Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs)
1) Facility Location model with a simple GUI built in TKinter.
2) Supply Chain Network Design model launched from a macro-enabled Excel file.

#### Machine Learning
1) An exercise in multivariate clustering of SKU-level sales, with associated CSV, using multiple algorithms
2) An exercise in time-series clustering of SKU-level demand, with associated CSV, using the k-means clustering algorithm.
3) A colab notebook with time series clustering and forecasting, as well as analysis

#### Discrete Event Simulation
1) A warehouse capacity simulation with simple GUI built in TKinter

#### Other
1) A toy model that generates and prints a random maze.
