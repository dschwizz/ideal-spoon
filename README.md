## Some projects that I am proud of and can share publicly.

The projects fall into four categories.
1) Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs)
2) Clustering
3) Discrete Event Simulation

There are two MILPs in Category one. The first has a simple GUI built in TKinter. The second is launched from a macro-enabled Excel file.
There are two files, in Category two, each with associated CSVs. One is an exercise in multivariate clustering. That file contains a variety of clustering algorithms. The other is an exercise in time-series clustering using the k-means clustering algorithm.
There is one discrete event simulation file. It has a simple GUI built in Tkinter.
There is also a toy model that generates a random maze. This was an exercise in applying a depth-first search algorithm.
